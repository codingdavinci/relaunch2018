# codingdavinci.de relaunch 2018

Coding da Vinci is the first German open cultural data hackathon. Founded in Berlin in 2014, Coding da Vinci is a project that encourages and supports GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) to share the digital records of their collections online under open licenses. It achieves this by making an extended hackathon-style event that brings those datasets (and the curators that manage them) into contact with the creative tech and open data communities, showing what can be possible when this kind of data is made open.

[codingdavinci.de](https://codingdavinci.de/) the website was launched in early 2014 in advance of the first Coding da Vinci event in Berlin, 26-27th April 2014. At that time, the website was built to communicate a single event, with the possibility that it might become a yearly event in Berlin. Since these beginnings, Coding da Vinci has grown from a single central annual event to a bigger project with multiple regional events, often running in parallel, managed by regional event teams, with growing collections of open datasets and the creative projects they have inspired. High time for a relaunch!

The primary use of this repository is for task management within the relaunch team throughout development of our new site. Tasks are broken down as [issues](https://github.com/codingdavinci/relaunch2018/issues) and prioritised/tracked in the ["Relaunch 2018" project kanban](https://github.com/codingdavinci/relaunch2018/projects/1).
